# 🔒 EncryptDrive: Secure Data Transfer Over the Cloud  
## 🚀 Overview  
**EncryptDrive** is a cutting-edge solution designed to ensure the **safe and secure transmission** of sensitive data in cloud environments.  
It protects data during **transit and storage**, ensuring that **only authorized users** can access the information while maintaining **data integrity** and **compliance** with privacy regulations.  

This project leverages **Amazon AWS** for **end-to-end encryption** and **advanced security protocols** to safeguard sensitive information.

## 🛠️ Features  
✔️ **End-to-End Encryption** – Protects data from unauthorized access.  
✔️ **AES Encryption (Advanced Encryption Standard)** – Highly secure encryption for data storage and transfer.  
✔️ **Key Schedule Algorithm** – Generates multiple **round keys** for enhanced security.  
✔️ **Compliance with Privacy Regulations** – Ensures secure handling of sensitive data.  
✔️ **Cloud Integration** – Utilizes **Amazon AWS** for secure data management.  


## 🔑 How AES Encryption Works?  
AES (**Advanced Encryption Standard**) is a **block cipher** that converts plaintext into unreadable ciphertext using a **symmetric key**.  

### **AES Specifications:**  
- 🔹 **Key Sizes:** 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit  
- 🔹 **Block Size:** 128 bits  
- 🔹 **Encryption Process:**  
  1️⃣ SubBytes (Byte Substitution)  
  2️⃣ ShiftRows  
  3️⃣ MixColumns  
  4️⃣ AddRoundKey (Key Scheduling)
